orbital_link_budget
===================

Simulates Earth orbits up to an eccentricity of 0.95.

Calculates link budget, azimuth and elevation, uptime/downtime, doppler shift.

Written for the University of British Columbia's Orbit Satellite Design Team.

Based on Satellite-Orbit-Simulation by deedydas.

The code is a bit messy (especially the function names); feel free to improve it.
