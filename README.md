orbital_link_budget
===================

Written for the University of British Columbia's Orbit Satellite Design Team.
Calculates link budget, azimuth and elevation, uptime/downtime, doppler shift.
Simulates Earth orbits up to an eccentricity of 0.95.

Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinates draw an unchanging orbit around a rotating Earth.
Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates draw a changing orbit around a stationary Earth.
